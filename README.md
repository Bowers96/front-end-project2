## About App
This app is along the lines of an event planner. You can sign up and log in and see all the events people have posted including: Title, Date of event and a Short description of the event. Once you have signed up and in you can add events to. The app allows you to update your events posts allowing you to change a date if for some reason it changes or maybe you want to change the description or title you can do it on Eventz.

## Development Process
+ Front-End<br>
  I started off by building the front-end of my project because I like to have some structure when I'm working on building my back end.
+ Building the Apps UI<br>
  I created a workable event planner representation which handled user actions. I struggled a bit to integrate my apps UI to the back-end, but with some fiddling in Atom, I made it all work.
+ Implementing Authentication<br>
  I followed the steps in the Authentication template repo we worked on in class and changed some code to fit my authentication UI implementation.
+ Linking the App to the Apps API<br>
  I struggled a lot at first with this step, I went back and forth and tried a number of different solutions. This definitely slowed my process down a little bit. But eventually I tied it all together.
+ Things to take care of<br>
  + I had hoped to implement a third-party api, but I ran out of time.
  + I did not use version control very effectively.
  + I would have liked to implement Handlebars.js in to my project.

##### App State:<br>

I decided to create a fun and playful mobile responsive web design, with a event planner integrated in because who doesn't have a bunch of fun events to go to and wants to share the information about them.
